Hello! To view our project properly you should:

-Run the node server
-Have mongoDB running
-Run apache
-and import our database with the mySQL dump

-You can also import the mongodump if you wish to view some example events we created, or you can create your own.

We have created one user in our database with admin priviliges.
The login for our admin profile is hardcoded in the form as a value
If you wish to create your admin user you need to manually set the admin status to 1 in the database.

Thanks for reading
